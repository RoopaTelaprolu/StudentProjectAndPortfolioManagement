**Portfolyx** is basically **Student Project and Portfolio Management System** where we have developed it using **Springboot** with **MySQL** database connectivity which also includes the front-end technologies **JSP**. The main aim of the project is to manage students projects and portfolios. There are three roles in our project the Admin, the Faculty and the Student. The Admin can add the faculty and student and can accept/reject the access of the faculty/student, and can be able view all the faculties and students who are given access to. The student can be able to upload/update their projects and portfolios, and select their mentor by themselves who they wish for and view their progress as milestones. The faculty can be able to view their respective student's projects, portfolios based on their ID and can give feedback to them.
